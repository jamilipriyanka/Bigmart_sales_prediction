## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebook
- **Environment**: Anaconda or virtualenv

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess sales data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize sales trends and patterns using graphs and charts.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Train various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict sales.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
- **Prediction**: Generate sales predictions for future periods based on the trained model.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bigmart-sales-prediction.git
   cd bigmart-sales-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Using virtualenv
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Or using conda
   conda create -n bigmart-env python=3.8
   conda activate bigmart-env
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To use this project for sales prediction:

1. Run Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open the main notebook:
   ```
   notebooks/bigmart_sales_prediction.ipynb
   ```

3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load and explore the data
   - Preprocess and clean the dataset
   - Train prediction models
   - Evaluate model performance
   - Generate predictions

## Data
The dataset contains sales information for products across different BigMart stores:

### Data Fields
- **Item_Identifier**: Unique product ID
- **Item_Weight**: Weight of product
- **Item_Fat_Content**: Whether the product is low fat or regular
- **Item_Visibility**: The percentage of total display area allocated to the product
- **Item_Type**: Category to which the product belongs
- **Item_MRP**: Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
- **Outlet_Identifier**: Unique store ID
- **Outlet_Establishment_Year**: The year in which the store was established
- **Outlet_Size**: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered
- **Outlet_Location_Type**: The type of area in which the store is located
- **Outlet_Type**: Whether the outlet is a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
- **Item_Outlet_Sales**: Sales of the product in the particular store (target variable)

### Data Sources
The data is available in two files:
- `data/Train_UWu5bXk.csv`: Training dataset
- `data/Test_u94Q5KV.csv`: Test dataset

## Modeling
The project implements and compares several machine learning models:

1. **Linear Regression**: Simple baseline model
2. **Ridge and Lasso Regression**: Linear models with regularization
3. **Decision Tree**: Non-linear model for capturing complex relationships
4. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees
5. **XGBoost**: Advanced gradient boosting algorithm

### Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using:
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- RÂ² Score
